# Introduction To Flutter
As a part of introduction, we will learn about what is flutter and why should we choose it?

# What is Flutter?

Flutter is an open source software development kit created by Google.
We can develop cross platform application for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia and web from a single codebase.
Single code-base means we only have to write our code once and it will work on multiple devices.

# Why choose Flutter?
The code development time with flutter is low. We juct need to develop in one code and the application can be launched to multiple platforms.
Decreased developent cost. We do not need different developers for application of different platforms. 
Same UI and Business Logic can be used in all Platforms.
Flutter has it's own rendering engine. So, complex UI can be developed easily.
Performance is similar to Native Application.
Powerful graphics and animation libraries.
Hot reload feature to restart application in no time.
Works well with Firebase as backend.
